# This project is using:
Auto-load PHP Classes (PSR-4)

# To run the code on terminal, please use the following command
`php index.php`

# VERY IMPORTANT NOTICE
Because it was not defined in the project description, I made an assumption that 2 or more containers can not be joined
together to create a big area.
This means that every shape/object that is bigger than the biggest container, can not be transported.
